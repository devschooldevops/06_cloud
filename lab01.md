# Setup azure devops

## 1. Create organization and project
### Person A:
- Log in to Azure DevOps
- Create a new organization (name does not matter)
- Create a new project within the organization called <your_team_name>
- Invite Person B to the project as a collaborator 
  - bonus: be a real project manager and send a kind reminder for person B person to accept the invite faster


## 2. Create the tasks
### Person B:
- In Azure DevOps, navigate to the Boards section 
- Create a new work item for each task in lab02.md
  - Add a description with any relevant details
  - Assign tags so you get a feel of them (eg: frontend, backend, devops, sysadmin, etc)

## 4. Task assignment
### Person A:
- Assign tasks to both of you, equally. 
- Task assignment should be rather equal
  - For example, you might do task 1 3 5 and your partner 2 4 6, etc
  - tip: you don't have to assign everything from the beginning

## 5. Ongoing sprint review
### Both people:
- Alternatively set the status of the tasks in azure devops (to do, doing, done)
